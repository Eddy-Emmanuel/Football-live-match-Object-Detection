# Football Live Match Object Detection

This repository contains code for detecting objects in football live match videos using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model.

## Files

- **app.py**: Python script for processing football live match videos.
- **best.pt**: Pre-trained YOLOv8 model file.
- **football-live-match-object-detection.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for object detection using YOLOv8.
- **madrid vs city.mp4**: Sample football live match video used for testing.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eddy-Emmanuel/Football-live-match-Object-Detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the `app.py` script or execute the code in the Jupyter notebook to perform object detection on football live match videos using YOLOv8.

## Usage

- Replace `madrid vs city.mp4` with your own football live match video.
- Modify the code in `app.py` or `football-live-match-object-detection.ipynb` to customize the object detection process according to your requirements.
